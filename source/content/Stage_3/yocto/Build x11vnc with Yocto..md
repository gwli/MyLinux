**Human:**
please teach me how to use yoctoproject?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's a brief guide to get you started with Yocto Project:

1. Install Required Dependencies


The first step is to install the required dependencies to run Yocto Project on your machine. Yocto Project requires a Linux distribution to run on. You will also need Git, Python 2.7, and the BitBake build tool.
<ol start="2">Clone Yocto Project</li></ol>
You can download the Yocto Project source code by cloning the Git repository. The command to clone the repository is:

```
$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky

```
<ol start="3">Build an Image</li></ol>
The next step is to build an image for your target device. To build an image, you need to configure your build environment by running the following command:

```
$ source poky/oe-init-build-env build_dir

```

This command will create a build directory and initialize the environment for you. The build directory is where the Yocto Project will build the image.
<ol start="4">Configure the Build</li></ol>
After creating the build directory, you will need to configure the build by setting up the layers, adding packages, and setting up other configuration files. The most important configuration file is `local.conf`, which is located in the build directory. You can edit this file to add your configuration settings.

To add layers to your build, modify the `bblayers.conf` file in the build directory. You can add additional layers using the `BBLAYERS` variable.
<ol start="5">Build the Image</li></ol>
Once you have configured the build, you can build the image using the `bitbake` command. For example, to build the minimal image, run the following command:

```
$ bitbake core-image-minimal

```

This command will build the image and output the resulting image in the `tmp/deploy/images` directory.
<ol start="6">Deploy the Image</li></ol>
After building the image, you can deploy it to your target device. You can use a variety of methods to deploy the image, including SD card, USB, or network boot.

That's a brief overview of how to use Yocto Project. Of course, there is a lot more to learn, and you will need to dive deeper into the documentation to get the most out of it. But this should be enough to get you started!


***

**Human:**
how to customize the build?

***

**Assistant:**

Customizing the build with Yocto Project involves modifying the configuration files and adding custom packages or layers to the build. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. Configure Local.conf


The first step in customizing the build is to configure the local.conf file. This file is located in the build directory and contains the configuration settings for the build. You can modify this file to change the default settings for the build.

For example, you can modify the local.conf file to change the package manager used in the build or to enable/disable specific features or recipes.
<ol start="2">Modify Layers</li></ol>
Yocto Project uses layers to organize its source code and build files. The core layer contains the core functionality of the build, while additional layers can be added to extend the functionality.

To modify a layer, you can add or remove recipes, configuration files, or scripts. You can also modify the build system's behavior by adding or modifying the classes, functions, or tasks used by the build.
<ol start="3">Add Custom Packages</li></ol>
To add custom packages to the build, you can create a new recipe file in a custom layer or modify an existing recipe file. The recipe file contains the instructions for building the package, including the source code location, dependencies, and build commands.

Once you have created the recipe file, you can add it to the build by including the layer in the BBLAYERS variable in the build configuration.
<ol start="4">Build the Custom Image</li></ol>
After you have made the necessary changes to the configuration and layers, you can build the custom image by running the bitbake command with the image you want to build. For example, to build the custom image based on the core-image-minimal recipe, run the following command:

```
$ bitbake core-image-minimal

```

This command will build the custom image based on the configuration and layers you have modified.

In summary, customizing the build with Yocto Project involves modifying the local.conf file, modifying layers, adding custom packages, and building the custom image. With these steps, you can customize the build to meet your specific requirements.


***

**Human:**
how to add a new layer?

***

**Assistant:**

To add a new layer to Yocto Project, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the Layer Directory


The first step is to create a new directory for your layer. The directory should have a unique name and be located in the `layers/` directory of your Yocto Project installation. For example, if you want to create a layer named `mylayer`, you can create the directory using the following command:

```
$ mkdir -p <path-to-yocto>/layers/meta-mylayer

```
<ol start="2">Create the Layer Configuration File</li></ol>
Next, create a configuration file for your layer in the `conf/` directory of your layer. The configuration file should have the name `layer.conf`. This file defines the layer's metadata, such as the layer's name, version, and dependencies.

Here's an example `layer.conf` file:

```
# LAYER CONFIGURATION FILE

BBPATH .= ":${LAYERDIR}"

BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
            ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"

BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "mylayer"
BBFILE_PATTERN_mylayer = "^${LAYERDIR}/"

LAYERVERSION_mylayer = "1"
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_mylayer = "sumo"

# LAYER DEPENDENCIES
DEPENDS += "core-image-minimal"


```

This configuration file defines a new layer named `mylayer` that depends on the `core-image-minimal` recipe. It also specifies the location of the layer's recipe files.
<ol start="3">Add Recipe Files</li></ol>
Add the recipe files for your layer to the `recipes/` directory of your layer. The recipe files are used by Yocto Project to build the packages that are included in the image.

For example, you can create a recipe file for a package named `mypackage` in the `recipes-mylayer/` directory with the following contents:

```
SUMMARY = "My Package"
LICENSE = "MIT"

SRC_URI = "file://my_source_code.tar.gz"

do_compile() {
    # Build commands
}

do_install() {
    # Install commands
}


```
<ol start="4">Add the Layer to BBLAYERS</li></ol>
Finally, add the new layer to the `BBLAYERS` variable in the build configuration file (`conf/local.conf`). Here's an example:

```
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  <path-to-yocto>/layers/meta \
  <path-to-yocto>/layers/meta-mylayer \
  "

```

This configuration tells Yocto Project to include the `mylayer` layer in the build.

Once you've completed these steps, you can run the `bitbake` command to build the image with the packages from your new layer.


***

**Human:**
teach me to how to use bitbake build system?

***

**Assistant:**

BitBake is the build system used by Yocto Project to build images and packages. Here are some steps to get you started with using BitBake:

1. Setup Environment


Before you can use BitBake, you need to set up the build environment. This involves sourcing the environment setup script that is generated by Yocto Project when you initialize the build system. You can do this by running the following command:

```
$ source <path-to-yocto>/oe-init-build-env

```

This command will create a new build directory and generate the environment setup script for that directory.
<ol start="2">Understand the Recipe Format</li></ol>
Recipes are the core building blocks of BitBake. A recipe is a set of instructions that tells BitBake how to build a package. The recipe format is based on Makefiles and consists of a set of variables and functions.

Here's an example recipe for building the `HelloWorld` package:

```
SUMMARY = "Hello World Example"
LICENSE = "MIT"

SRC_URI = "file://helloworld.c"

do_compile() {
    ${CC} helloworld.c -o helloworld
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}/usr/bin
    install -m 0755 helloworld ${D}/usr/bin
}

```

The recipe contains variables that specify metadata about the package (such as the summary and license), as well as functions that define the build and installation steps.
<ol start="3">Run BitBake</li></ol>
To build a package, you can use the `bitbake` command with the name of the recipe. For example, to build the `HelloWorld` package, you can run the following command:

```
$ bitbake helloworld

```

This command will build the package according to the instructions in the recipe.
<ol start="4">Customize the Build</li></ol>
You can customize the build by modifying the configuration files and adding custom packages or layers. The `local.conf` file in the build directory contains the configuration settings for the build. You can modify this file to change the default settings for the build.

You can also add custom packages to the build by creating a new recipe file or modifying an existing recipe file. The recipe file contains the instructions for building the package, including the source code location, dependencies, and build commands.
<ol start="5">Build an Image</li></ol>
An image is a complete operating system that includes a set of packages and configuration files. To build an image with BitBake, you can use the `bitbake` command with the name of the image recipe. For example, to build the `core-image-minimal` image, you can run the following command:

```
$ bitbake core-image-minimal

```

This command will build the image according to the instructions in the recipe and include all of the packages and configuration files that are required to create a minimal operating system.

In summary, using BitBake involves setting up the build environment, understanding the recipe format, running BitBake to build packages and images, customizing the build, and building an image. With these steps, you can use BitBake to create custom images and packages for your Yocto Project-based projects.


***

**Human:**
how to do cross-compiling with bitbake?

***

**Assistant:**

Cross-compiling with BitBake involves building packages or images for a different target architecture than the one on which you are building. Here are the steps to cross-compile with BitBake:

1. Set the Target Architecture


The first step is to set the target architecture in the build configuration. This is done by setting the `MACHINE` variable in the `local.conf` file. For example, if you want to build for the ARM architecture, you can set `MACHINE = "raspberrypi3"`.
<ol start="2">Choose the Cross-Compiler</li></ol>
The next step is to choose the cross-compiler to use for building the packages or images. The cross-compiler is a compiler that runs on the host machine but generates code for the target architecture.

To choose the cross-compiler, you need to set the `TARGET_SYS` and `TARGET_CC_ARCH` variables in the `local.conf` file. For example, if you are building for the ARM architecture, you can set `TARGET_SYS = "arm-poky-linux-gnueabi"` and `TARGET_CC_ARCH = "armv7-a"`.
<ol start="3">Build the Packages or Images</li></ol>
Once the target architecture and cross-compiler are set, you can build the packages or images as usual with the `bitbake` command. For example, to build the `HelloWorld` package for the ARM architecture, you can run the following command:

```
$ bitbake helloworld -c compile -f -k

```

This command will build the `HelloWorld` package using the cross-compiler and generate binary code for the ARM architecture.
<ol start="4">Install and Run the Packages or Images</li></ol>
Finally, you can install and run the packages or images on the target device. You will need to transfer the binary files to the target device and install them according to the device's instructions. For example, if you are building an image for a Raspberry Pi, you can transfer the image to an SD card and insert the card into the Raspberry Pi to boot the system.

In summary, cross-compiling with BitBake involves setting the target architecture and cross-compiler in the build configuration, building the packages or images as usual with the `bitbake` command, and installing and running the packages or images on the target device.


***

**Human:**
put example of helloworld together

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's an example of how to build and run a "Hello World" program using BitBake for a specific target architecture:

1. Set the Target Architecture


Let's say we want to build for the ARM architecture. We can set the `MACHINE` variable in the `local.conf` file to `raspberrypi3`, which is a popular ARM-based device:

```
$ echo 'MACHINE = "raspberrypi3"' >> conf/local.conf

```
<ol start="2">Choose the Cross-Compiler</li></ol>
Next, we need to choose the cross-compiler to use for building the program. For ARM, we can use the `arm-poky-linux-gnueabi` toolchain, which is provided by the Yocto Project:

```
$ echo 'TARGET_SYS = "arm-poky-linux-gnueabi"' >> conf/local.conf
$ echo 'TARGET_CC_ARCH = "armv7-a"' >> conf/local.conf

```
<ol start="3">Create the Recipe</li></ol>
Now, we need to create a recipe for the "Hello World" program. The recipe defines how to build the program, where to get the source code, and any dependencies. We can create a new recipe in the `meta-custom/recipes-example` directory, which we previously added as a new layer:

```
$ mkdir -p meta-custom/recipes-example/helloworld
$ cd meta-custom/recipes-example/helloworld
$ touch helloworld_1.0.bb

```

Open the `helloworld_1.0.bb` file with your favorite text editor and add the following content:

```
DESCRIPTION = "A simple Hello World program"
SECTION = "examples"
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"
SRC_URI = "file://hello.c"
S = "${WORKDIR}"
TARGET_CC_ARCH += "${LDFLAGS}"

do_compile() {
    ${CC} ${LDFLAGS} hello.c -o helloworld
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}${bindir}
    install -m 0755 helloworld ${D}${bindir}
}

```

This recipe defines a program called "Hello World" with a single source file `hello.c`. The `do_compile` function compiles the program using the cross-compiler, and the `do_install` function installs the binary file into the target root filesystem.
<ol start="4">Build the Program</li></ol>
Now we can build the program using BitBake:

```
$ source oe-init-build-env
$ bitbake helloworld

```

This command tells BitBake to build the "Hello World" program using the cross-compiler for the ARM architecture.
<ol start="5">Install and Run the Program</li></ol>
After the build completes, the binary file will be located in the `tmp/deploy/{target}/bin` directory, where `{target}` is the target architecture specified in `MACHINE`. For ARM, the file will be `helloworld`:

```
$ scp tmp/deploy/raspberrypi3/helloworld pi@{pi_address}:/home/pi

```

This command transfers the binary file to a Raspberry Pi device with IP address `{pi_address}`.

Now we can log into the Raspberry Pi and run the program:

```
$ ssh pi@{pi_address}
$ ./helloworld

```

This command should print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

And that's it! You've successfully built and run a "Hello World" program using BitBake for a specific target architecture.


***

**Human:**
you are missing helloworld.c source file

***

**Assistant:**

You're right! I apologize for that. Here's the content for `helloworld.c`:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

```

This is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console when executed. You can save this code to a file called `hello.c` and include it in the recipe as shown in Step 3 of my previous response.


***

**Human:**
where to put this file?

***

**Assistant:**

You can put the `helloworld.c` file in the same directory as the recipe file `helloworld_1.0.bb` that you created in Step 3 of my previous response. In this case, that would be `meta-custom/recipes-example/helloworld/`.

Alternatively, you can put the source code file in a separate directory, and modify the `SRC_URI` variable in the recipe to point to the file's location. For example, if you put the `helloworld.c` file in a directory called `files` in the same location as the recipe file, you can modify the `SRC_URI` variable like this:

```
SRC_URI = "file://helloworld.c"

```

This tells BitBake to look for the `helloworld.c` file in the same directory as the recipe file. When the recipe is built, the source code file will be copied to the `WORKDIR` variable specified in the recipe, which is then used to compile the program.


***

**Human:**
what's the poky?

***

**Assistant:**

Poky is a reference distribution of the Yocto Project, which is a set of tools and metadata used to create custom Linux-based systems for embedded devices. Poky provides a set of recipes, configuration files, and tools that can be used to build a complete Linux distribution from source code, tailored to the specific requirements of an embedded system.

Poky is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to add their own custom layers and recipes to the build process. It also includes a set of default layers and recipes that can be used to build a basic Linux distribution for a wide range of embedded devices.

Poky is maintained by the Yocto Project community and is available for free under an open-source license. It is widely used in the embedded systems industry to build customized Linux distributions for a variety of applications, including automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics.


***

**Human:**
what's layers relation of the Poky?

***

**Assistant:**

In the context of the Yocto Project and Poky, a "layer" is a collection of metadata, configuration files, and recipes that can be added to the build system to extend its capabilities or modify its behavior. Layers are used to customize the build process for a particular project or target device.

Layers are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each layer building on top of the previous layer. The base layer is the Poky distribution itself, which provides the core components of the Linux operating system. Above the Poky layer are additional layers that can be added to provide more specific functionality or customization.

For example, a layer might provide recipes for building a specific application, or configuration files for customizing the kernel or system services. Layers can also include patches, scripts, and other files that are used to modify the build process or add new features.

The Yocto Project includes a number of default layers that can be used as a starting point for building custom systems, and there is a large community of developers who create and maintain their own layers for specific applications or target devices. By using layers, developers can create customized Linux distributions that are tailored to their specific requirements, while leveraging the powerful tools and infrastructure provided by the Yocto Project and Poky.


***

**Human:**
how add dependencies for a layer or recipes?

***

**Assistant:**

To add dependencies for a layer or recipe in the Yocto Project, you can use the `DEPENDS` variable in the recipe's `.bb` file. This variable specifies a list of other recipes or packages that the current recipe or layer depends on. When the build system encounters a recipe with dependencies, it will automatically build and include those dependencies in the final image.

Here's an example of how to use `DEPENDS` to add dependencies to a recipe:

```
DESCRIPTION = "A recipe that depends on some other recipe"
LICENSE = "MIT"

DEPENDS = "other-recipe"

SRC_URI = "file://helloworld.c"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_compile() {
    ${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS} helloworld.c -o helloworld
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}${bindir}
    install -m 0755 helloworld ${D}${bindir}
}

```

In this example, the `DEPENDS` variable specifies that the current recipe depends on another recipe called `other-recipe`. When this recipe is built, the build system will automatically build and include `other-recipe` as well.

You can also use the `RDEPENDS` variable to specify runtime dependencies, which are packages or recipes that are required for the recipe to run properly. For example:

```
RDEPENDS_${PN} = "other-package"

```

In this case, `${PN}` refers to the package name of the current recipe, and `RDEPENDS` specifies that it requires the `other-package` package to be installed in order to run properly.

Note that adding dependencies can increase the size of the final image, so it's important to only include the packages that are actually needed for the target device or application.


***

**Human:**
what does bitbake-layers use/

***

**Assistant:**

`bitbake-layers` is a command-line tool used in the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded build systems to manage layers in a project. It provides a set of sub-commands that can be used to perform a variety of layer-related tasks, such as adding or removing layers, listing the layers in a project, and displaying information about the layers and their contents.

When you run `bitbake-layers`, it reads a configuration file called `bblayers.conf`, which is located in the top-level directory of your build environment. This file contains a list of paths to the layers that are included in the build, in the order in which they should be processed.

`bitbake-layers` uses this list to determine the location of the various configuration files, recipes, and other files that are needed for the build process. It also uses this list to determine the dependencies between the layers, and to ensure that the layers are processed in the correct order.

In addition to managing the layers in your build environment, `bitbake-layers` can also be used to perform other tasks, such as displaying information about the contents of a layer or verifying the integrity of the layers in your build environment. It is a powerful and flexible tool that is essential for working with layers in the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded build systems.

**Human:**
bitbake complain can't find meta-custom/conf/layer.conf in the above hellworld example

***

**Assistant:**

The error message "bitbake: can't find meta-custom/conf/layer.conf" suggests that the build system is unable to locate the `layer.conf` file for the custom layer you are trying to add.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that you have created the `layer.conf` file and placed it in the correct location within your custom layer directory. The `layer.conf` file is a mandatory configuration file for a Yocto layer, and it provides metadata and settings for the layer.

Here are the steps you can follow to create the `layer.conf` file and place it in the correct location:

1. 
In your custom layer directory, create a new directory called `conf`.

2. 
Inside the `conf` directory, create a file called `layer.conf` and add the following contents:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>graphql</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-graphql p-4"><span class="hljs-comment"># Set the priority of this layer, lower numbers are higher priority</span>

**Human:**
ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES "helloworld"

***

**Assistant:**

The error message "ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES 'helloworld'" suggests that BitBake is unable to find a recipe or package named "helloworld" that it can use to satisfy a dependency.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that you have created a recipe for your "helloworld" application and included it in your custom layer.

Here are the steps you can follow to create a recipe for your "helloworld" application:

1. 
In your custom layer directory, create a new directory called `recipes-helloworld`.

2. 
Inside the `recipes-helloworld` directory, create a new file called `helloworld_1.0.bb`. This file should contain the recipe for your "helloworld" application.

3. 
In the `helloworld_1.0.bb` file, add the following code:

**Human:**
unable to get checksum for helloworld SRC_URI entry hello.c

***

**Assistant:**

The error message "unable to get checksum for helloworld SRC_URI entry hello.c" indicates that the build system is unable to determine the checksum for the `SRC_URI` entry `file://helloworld.c`.

To fix this error, you can add a `SRC_URI[md5sum]` variable to your recipe that specifies the MD5 checksum of the `helloworld.c` file. Here's an updated version of the recipe with the `md5sum` variable added:

```
SUMMARY = "Hello World Application"
DESCRIPTION = "A simple 'Hello, World!' application."
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"
SECTION = "examples"
DEPENDS = ""

SRC_URI = "file://helloworld.c"
SRC_URI[md5sum] = "b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_compile() {
    ${CC} helloworld.c -o helloworld
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}${bindir}
    install -m 0755 helloworld ${D}${bindir}
}

```

Make sure to replace the MD5 checksum value with the actual MD5 checksum of your `helloworld.c` file.

Once you've updated your recipe, run the `bitbake` command again to rebuild your application.

***

**Assistant:**

The error message "File /usr/bin/helloworld in package helloworld doesn't have GNU_HASH" indicates that the binary file generated by your recipe doesn't have the `GNU_HASH` section, which is required by the package manager on some systems.

To fix this error, you can add the following line to your recipe to ensure that the `GNU_HASH` section is added to the binary:

```
LDFLAGS_append = " -Wl,--hash-style=gnu"

```

Here's an updated version of the recipe with the `LDFLAGS_append` variable added:

```

ERROR: Parsing halted due to errors, see error messages above

***

**Assistant:**

The error message "Variable LDFLAGS_append file: ... contains an operation using the old override syntax" indicates that the `LDFLAGS_append` variable in your recipe is using an older syntax that is no longer supported in newer versions of Bitbake.

To fix this error, you should update the `LDFLAGS_append` variable to use the newer syntax, which uses the `:=` operator instead of the older `=` operator. Here's how you can update the recipe:

```
SUMMARY = "Hello World Application"
DESCRIPTION = "A simple 'Hello, World!' application."
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

}

do_install() {

    install -m 0755 helloworld ${D}${bindir}
}

```

After updating the recipe, run the `bitbake` command again to rebuild your application.


***

**Human:**
it still report the same error

***

**Assistant:**

If you are still seeing the same error message after updating the `LDFLAGS_append` variable syntax, it's possible that the error is caused by another issue.

One possible cause of the error could be that the `LDFLAGS` variable is not set correctly. You can try adding the following line to your recipe:

```
LDFLAGS = "${LDFLAGS} -Wl,--hash-style=gnu"

```

This will ensure that the `LDFLAGS` variable is set correctly before the `LDFLAGS_append` variable is used.

If this does not solve the issue, please provide the full error message and any other relevant information so that I can better assist you.

Please convert this layer/metadata before attempting to use with a newer bitbake.
ERROR: Parsing halted due to errors, see error messages above

***

**Assistant:**

It seems like the error is caused by the `LDFLAGS_append` variable syntax. The error message suggests that the old override syntax is being used.

To fix this error, you can update the `LDFLAGS_append` variable syntax in your recipe by using the newer format. Replace the following line:

```
LDFLAGS_append = " -Wl,--hash-style=gnu"

```

with:

```
LDFLAGS_append := " -Wl,--hash-style=gnu"

```

The `:=` syntax tells BitBake to immediately evaluate the expression and assign the result to the variable, whereas the `=` syntax performs a lazy evaluation.

After making this change, try building the recipe again and see if the error is resolved.


***

**Human:**
no, it's not resolved, it still get the same error

***

**Assistant:**

If updating the syntax for `LDFLAGS_append` did not resolve the issue, there may be another issue with your recipe.

One possible cause of this error is that the `helloworld` binary is being stripped of its symbols during the package creation process. To prevent this, you can add the following line to your recipe:

```
INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP = "1"

```

This will tell BitBake to skip the stripping of symbols for the `helloworld` binary.

If this does not resolve the issue, please provide the full error message and any other relevant information so that I can better assist you.


***

**Human:**
bitbake hellworld only generate rpm package

***

**Assistant:**

If you're only seeing the `.rpm` package file generated, it's likely because the default `PACKAGE_CLASSES` in your `local.conf` or `bblayers.conf` file is set to only generate RPM packages.

To generate other types of package formats, such as `.deb`, you'll need to add the appropriate package class to your configuration. To do this, you can add the following line to your `local.conf` or `bblayers.conf` file:

```
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_deb package_rpm"

```

This tells BitBake to generate both Debian and RPM packages.

After adding this line, you can rebuild the `helloworld` recipe and you should see both `.deb` and `.rpm` packages generated.

Note that depending on your Yocto version and configuration, you may need to have the `dpkg` and `fakeroot` utilities installed on your host machine to enable the creation of `.deb` packages.


***

**Human:**
I also want the binary file

***

**Assistant:**

To generate just the binary file, you can use the `do_compile` task, which compiles the source code and generates the binary file.

To run `do_compile` for the `helloworld` recipe, you can use the following command:

```
bitbake helloworld -c compile

```

This will compile the source code and generate the binary file, which should be located in the `work` directory.

Note that the location of the binary file depends on the architecture and machine you are building for. If you are building for `core2-64-poky-linux`, the binary file should be located in the `work/core2-64-poky-linux/helloworld/1.0-r0/build` directory.

You can also use the `--target-only` option with `bitbake` to build just the binary file without generating the package:

```
bitbake helloworld --target-only compile

```

This will run only the `do_compile` task and skip the package generation tasks.

**Human:**
ERROR: No recipes in default available for:
  /mnt/work/git/clara/build_poky/poky/meta-custom/recipes-graphics/x11vnc/x11vnc_%.bbappend

***

**Assistant:**

This error occurs because BitBake is unable to find the base recipe for `x11vnc` in its default search paths. To resolve this, you need to make sure that the base recipe for `x11vnc` is available in your Yocto project.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. 
Check if the `x11vnc` recipe exists in any of the layers in your Yocto project by running the following command:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>lua</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-lua p-4"><span class="hljs-built_in">find</span> /<span class="hljs-built_in">path</span>/to/yocto/project -name <span class="hljs-string">"x11vnc*.bb"</span>
`</code></div></div></pre><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-lua p-4">
Replace `/path/to/yocto/project` with the actual path to your Yocto project directory.

If the recipe is found, note down the path to the directory containing the recipe.
</code>
2. <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-lua p-4">
If the recipe is not found, you need to add a layer that contains the recipe to your Yocto project. You can find layers containing `x11vnc` recipe by searching on the Yocto Project layer index website.

Once you have identified a suitable layer, add it to your `bblayers.conf` file, which is typically located in the `conf` directory of your build directory. For example, to add the `meta-oe` layer, you would add the following line to `bblayers.conf`:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>bash</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash p-4">/path/to/meta-oe

***

**Human:**
what's the difference between *.bb files and *.bbappend files?

***

**Assistant:**

In Yocto Project, the `.bb` files define the recipe for a particular component, whereas `.bbappend` files extend or modify the existing recipes in `.bb` files.

`.bb` files contain the complete recipe for a package, including the package name, version, source URI, build instructions, dependencies, and so on. These files are used to build a package from source code and create a binary package for installation on the target system.

On the other hand, `.bbappend` files are used to modify or add to an existing recipe defined in a `.bb` file. This allows you to add additional functionality, configuration options, dependencies, or patches to an existing recipe without needing to rewrite the entire recipe. `.bbappend` files are often used in layers to customize or extend the behavior of existing components or packages.

ERROR: Parsing halted due to errors, see error messages above

***

**Assistant:**

This error indicates that the `LICENSE` field is not set in the `x11vnc_1.0.bb` recipe file. It is a mandatory field in a recipe file and must be set to indicate the license under which the software is distributed.

To fix this error, you can add the `LICENSE` field to the `x11vnc_1.0.bb` recipe file and set it to the appropriate license. For example, if the software is distributed under the MIT license, you can add the following line to the recipe file:

```
LICENSE = "MIT"

```

Make sure to save the changes and re-run the build command.


***

**Human:**
ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES "graphics"

***

**Assistant:**

This error message indicates that there is a missing dependency in your recipe or in your image recipe. The package or feature named "graphics" could not be found in any available layer or recipe.

To resolve this error, you need to identify which recipe or layer is providing the "graphics" package or feature and add it to your build. You can do this by running the following command:

```
bitbake-layers show-recipes | grep graphics

```

This command will show you all the available recipes and layers that provide the "graphics" package or feature. You can then add the appropriate recipe or layer to your build by adding it to your `bblayers.conf` file or by adding it as a dependency in your recipe or image recipe.

Once you have added the necessary dependency, save the changes and re-run the build command.

**Assistant:**

The error message suggests that the Bitbake fetcher was unable to download the source code archive for x11vnc. Specifically, the command that was run to download the archive failed with exit code 8, indicating that there was some sort of problem with the download. Unfortunately, the error message doesn't provide any additional information about what specifically went wrong.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. 
Check your internet connection: Make sure that your computer has a stable internet connection and that you can access other websites and services without any issues.

2. 
Check the URL: Double-check the URL for the source code archive in the error message and make sure that it is correct.

3. 
Try downloading the archive manually: If you're not able to download the archive through Bitbake, try downloading it manually using your web browser or a tool like wget. Once you have the archive, move it to the appropriate directory in your Poky build directory (typically `&lt;poky&gt;/downloads`) so that Bitbake can find it.

4. 
Use a different source URL: If the source URL in the error message is not working, try searching for a different URL where the source code archive is available and update the recipe accordingly.



I hope this helps!

ERROR: x11vnc-1.0-r0 do_populate_lic: QA Issue: x11vnc: Recipe file fetches files and does not have license file information (LIC_FILES_CHKSUM) [license-checksum]

***

**Assistant:**

This error message is indicating that the recipe for the `x11vnc` package is missing a `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable, which is used to ensure that the license files included in the package are properly licensed.

To resolve this error, you need to add the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable to the recipe. This variable should contain a checksum of the license file or files included in the package. The `meta/classes/license.bbclass` file in the Yocto Project provides a set of functions that can be used to generate the checksum.

Here is an example of what the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable could look like in the `x11vnc` recipe:

```
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=55a2e47a090d1e8fc1af91c883b19f2f"

```

In this example, the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable contains a checksum for the `COPYING` file, which is included in the package. The `md5` value is generated using the `checksum` function provided by `license.bbclass`.

Once you have added the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable to the recipe, rebuild the package to ensure that the error is resolved.

***

**Assistant:**

The error message indicates that the `autoreconf` step of the `do_configure` task in the `x11vnc_0.9.16.bb` recipe failed. The specific error message is: "configure.ac:40: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_DEFINE".

This error suggests that there might be a problem with the `configure.ac` file in the `x11vnc` source code. One possible cause of this error is a missing or incorrectly specified macro in the `configure.ac` file.

To debug this issue, you may want to examine the `configure.ac` file in the `x11vnc` source code and look for any missing or incorrect macros. You can also try running the `autoreconf` command manually on the source code outside of the Yocto build system to see if it produces the same error message.

Once you have identified the issue, you can modify the recipe to fix the problem. This might involve modifying the `configure.ac` file, updating the build configuration, or modifying the recipe to use a different version of `x11vnc`.


***

**Human:**
how add autoreconf options to *.bb file

***

**Assistant:**

To add autoreconf options to a *.bb file, you can modify the `EXTRA_AUTORECONF` variable. This variable contains extra arguments that should be passed to `autoreconf` during the build process. Here's an example of how to add the `m4_pattern_allow` option to `autoreconf`:

```
EXTRA_AUTORECONF = "--force --install --verbose --m4='m4 -I m4 -I /usr/share/aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal' -I config -I conf --m4dir=m4 m4_pattern_allow([AC_DEFINE])"

```

In this example, we're adding the `m4_pattern_allow([AC_DEFINE])` option, which allows the `AC_DEFINE` macro to be used without raising an error. We're also including several other options that may be useful, such as `--verbose` to print more information during the build process.

You can add this line to the end of your `x11vnc_0.9.16.bb` file, just before the `do_configure` task. Don't forget to re-build the package after making this change.

|       |          ^~~~~~~~~~~

***

**Assistant:**

The error message suggests that the file `rfb.h` cannot be found. This file is part of the `libvncserver` library, which `x11vnc` depends on. It is possible that the library is not installed or is not properly configured.

To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:

1. 
Check if the `libvncserver` library is installed on your system. You can do this by running the command `dpkg -l libvncserver-dev` or `yum list installed libvncserver-devel`. If the library is not installed, install it using the appropriate package manager for your system.

2. 
If the library is already installed, make sure that the `rfb.h` header file is included in the include path for the compiler. You can check this by looking at the `CFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` variables in the Makefile. If the include path is not set correctly, you can add it by modifying these variables. For example, you can add the following line to your Makefile:

`CPPFLAGS += -I/path/to/libvncserver/include`

Make sure to replace `/path/to/libvncserver/include` with the actual path to the `include` directory of the `libvncserver` library.

3. 
After making any changes to the Makefile, re-run the `make` command to rebuild the `x11vnc` binary.




***

**Human:**
you forget this build with yocto

***

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. If you are building with Yocto, you can add the necessary package to your build by adding it to your recipe's dependencies.

Assuming that the missing `rfb/rfb.h` header is part of the "libvncserver" package, you can add it as a dependency in your recipe's `DEPENDS` variable like so:

```
DEPENDS = "libvncserver"

```

Then you can rebuild your recipe and the missing header should be included.


***

**Human:**
no, x11vnc-0.9.12 has include rfb folder just compiler can't find it

***

**Assistant:**

I see, thank you for clarifying. In that case, you may need to add the path to the `rfb` header files to the `CPPFLAGS` environment variable.

You can do this by adding the following line to your `x11vnc_0.9.12.bb` recipe file:

```
export CPPFLAGS="-I${S}/rfb $CPPFLAGS"

```

This will add the `rfb` subdirectory of the source tree to the include search path when the code is compiled.

bitbake how to clean an recipes

***

**Assistant:**

To clean a recipe in BitBake, you can use the following command:

```
bitbake <recipe-name> -c clean

```

This command will remove all generated files and temporary build artifacts for the specified recipe. If you want to clean the entire build directory for a recipe, you can use the following command:

```
bitbake <recipe-name> -c cleansstate

```

This command will remove the entire build directory for the specified recipe, including any downloaded source code, patches, and other build artifacts. Note that this command will require the recipe to be rebuilt from scratch the next time it is built.


***

**Human:**
where to add CPPFLAG in .bb file

***

**Assistant:**

You can add `CPPFLAGS` to a `.bb` recipe file using the `inherit` statement to include the `autotools` class and then defining the `EXTRA_OECONF` variable. Here's an example:

```
inherit autotools

EXTRA_OECONF += "CPPFLAGS='-I${STAGING_DIR_TARGET}/include'"

```

In this example, we are adding the `CPPFLAGS` option with the `-I` flag to include the `STAGING_DIR_TARGET` directory's `include` folder. You can replace this path with the path to the folder containing the header file you want to include.


***

**Human:**
merge these two fixes

***

**Assistant:**

To merge the two fixes, you can add the `CPPFLAGS` in the `do_configure_prepend` section of the `.bb` file like this:

```
do_configure_prepend() {
    export CPPFLAGS="-I${S}/rfb"
    aclocal -I m4
    autoconf
}

```

This will set the `CPPFLAGS` environment variable to include the `rfb` directory in the source directory, and then run the `aclocal` and `autoconf` commands.


***

**Human:**
after these fixes, C compiler cannot create executables

***

**Assistant:**

This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the configuration of the build environment or with the toolchain being used. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. 
Check the output of the configure script to see if there are any errors or warnings that could be causing the issue. The configure script is responsible for setting up the build environment and can provide useful information about what might be going wrong.

2. 
Check that the necessary build dependencies are installed. The build dependencies are the libraries and tools that are required to build the software. You can check the recipe for the package you are trying to build to see what dependencies are required.

3. 
Check that the toolchain is properly configured. The toolchain is the set of tools that are used to build the software, including the compiler, linker, and other utilities. Make sure that the toolchain is properly configured and that all necessary components are installed.

4. 
Try cleaning the build directory and rebuilding the package. Sometimes a clean build can resolve issues with the build environment.

5. 
If none of the above steps work, try rebuilding the entire image to ensure that the build environment is set up correctly.




***

**Human:**
how to use CPPFLAGS?

***

**Assistant:**

The CPPFLAGS variable can be used to specify additional flags to be passed to the C preprocessor (cpp) when compiling C code.

In a Yocto recipe (.bb file), you can set CPPFLAGS by adding the following line to the recipe:

```
CPPFLAGS += "<flags>"

```

For example, to add the "-I/usr/include/mylib" flag to CPPFLAGS, you would add the following line to the recipe:

```
CPPFLAGS += "-I/usr/include/mylib"

```

Note that the above example assumes that the "/usr/include/mylib" directory contains header files needed by the C code being compiled. If the directory is different in your case, you should modify the flag accordingly.


***

**Human:**
CFLAGS

***

**Assistant:**

CFLAGS is an environment variable that is used to specify additional flags for the C compiler. These flags can be used to set various compiler options, such as optimization level, debug symbols, or include directories.

In a Yocto/OpenEmbedded recipe, you can set CFLAGS by adding the following line to your recipe file:

```
CFLAGS += "<your desired flags>"

```

For example, if you wanted to set the optimization level to -O2, you would add:

```
CFLAGS += "-O2"

```

You can also append to the existing value of CFLAGS by using the += operator. For example, if you wanted to add the -g flag for debug symbols without overwriting any existing flags, you would add:

```
CFLAGS += "-g"

```

It's worth noting that many packages use autotools for their build system, and autotools will often automatically append various flags to CFLAGS, such as -fPIC for position-independent code. In these cases, you can use the `oe_runconf` function to set CFLAGS, as shown in the previous example for CPPFLAGS.

***

**Assistant:**

This error message is indicating that there are multiple definitions of the variable `clientMutex` and the linker (`ld`) is unable to resolve which definition to use. The first definition is in the object file `x11vnc-8to24.o` and the second definition is in the object file `x11vnc-xwrappers.o`. As a result, the linker is returning an error and the make command is failing.

To fix this error, you need to ensure that `clientMutex` is defined only once. You can do this by declaring `clientMutex` as `extern` in a header file, and defining it only in a single source file.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

1. 
Create a header file, `x11vnc.h`, and add the following line to it:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>c</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-c p-4"><span class="hljs-keyword">extern</span> <span class="hljs-type">pthread_mutex_t</span> clientMutex;

2. <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-c p-4">
In the source file `x11vnc-xwrappers.c`, remove the declaration of `pthread_mutex_t clientMutex`, and include `x11vnc.h` at the top of the file:

**Human:**
what's difference between openembeded and poky?

***

**Assistant:**

OpenEmbedded is a build framework that allows you to create custom Linux distributions for embedded systems. It provides a set of tools and scripts to build complete Linux distributions from source code. Poky, on the other hand, is a reference distribution that is built using the OpenEmbedded build system.

In other words, Poky is an example of how to build a Linux distribution using OpenEmbedded. It provides a set of default configurations and recipes for packages that can be used as a starting point for creating your own custom Linux distribution.

OpenEmbedded is a more general-purpose build framework that can be used to create a wide range of Linux distributions for different embedded systems. It is highly configurable and provides a great deal of flexibility in terms of the packages that can be included in the final image, as well as the target hardware and software configurations.

Overall, while both OpenEmbedded and Poky can be used to build Linux distributions for embedded systems, OpenEmbedded provides more flexibility and is better suited for creating custom distributions tailored to specific requirements. Poky, on the other hand, is a good starting point for those who are new to embedded Linux development or who want a reference distribution to use as a baseline.


***

**Human:**
what's relation of BBLAYERS?

***

**Assistant:**

In OpenEmbedded and Poky, `BBLAYERS` is an environment variable that specifies the location of the layers that should be used by BitBake, the build tool used by OpenEmbedded and Poky.

Each layer provides recipes and configuration files needed to build a set of software packages. By default, the `BBLAYERS` variable includes the `poky` layer, which contains basic recipes and configuration files, and additional layers can be added to provide more functionality.

The order of the layers in the `BBLAYERS` variable is important, as it determines the order in which the recipes and configuration files are loaded. Recipes and configuration files in earlier layers have priority over those in later layers, so it's important to order the layers correctly to avoid conflicts and ensure that the desired behavior is achieved.

Overall, `BBLAYERS` is an important variable for configuring the OpenEmbedded and Poky build environment and specifying which layers and recipes should be used for a particular build.


***

**Human:**
what's REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES ?

***

**Assistant:**

`REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES` is a variable used in Yocto/OpenEmbedded build systems to specify the set of features that are required by the target distribution.

Features are collections of functionality that are expected to be present in the target distribution, such as support for a particular filesystem, package management system, or init system. By setting `REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES`, you can ensure that the packages you build for the target distribution only depend on features that are actually available in the target distribution.

For example, if you are building a package that requires systemd as the init system, you can set `REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES` to include `systemd`. If systemd is not available in the target distribution, the build system will report an error and the package will not be built.

`REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES` is typically set in the `local.conf` file in the Yocto/OpenEmbedded build system.


***

**Human:**
what does inherit cmake features_check pkgconfig

***

**Assistant:**

`inherit` is a bitbake directive that is used in recipe files in Yocto/OpenEmbedded to include one or more classes into the recipe. Each class provides a set of functionality or metadata, such as adding dependencies, setting environment variables, etc.

`cmake` is a class that sets up the recipe to use the CMake build system, which is an alternative to the autotools build system. It provides the necessary configuration files, cmake.bbclass and cmake-utils.bbclass, and defines several tasks, such as cmake_do_configure, cmake_do_compile, and cmake_do_install.

`features_check` is a class that checks for certain features in the target distribution that the recipe depends on. It checks if the features are enabled and if the correct version is available. It is used to avoid runtime errors by ensuring that the target environment meets the recipe's requirements.

`pkgconfig` is a class that sets up the recipe to use pkg-config, a tool that helps to locate and use libraries, headers, and other resources in the system. It provides the necessary configuration files and defines several tasks, such as pkgconfig_do_configure, pkgconfig_do_compile, and pkgconfig_do_install.

In summary, `inherit cmake features_check pkgconfig` is used to set up a recipe to use the CMake build system, check for required features in the target distribution, and use pkg-config to locate and use libraries and headers.


***

**Human:**
ANY_OF_DISTRO_FEATURES

***

**Assistant:**

`ANY_OF_DISTRO_FEATURES` is a variable in the Yocto Project build system that allows you to specify a list of distribution features that are required for a recipe to build. This variable is used in the recipe metadata to specify which features are required by a recipe.

The `ANY_OF_DISTRO_FEATURES` variable is used in conjunction with the `REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES` variable. The `REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES` variable specifies a list of features that a recipe must have in order to build, while `ANY_OF_DISTRO_FEATURES` specifies a list of features that a recipe can optionally have.

For example, suppose a recipe requires the "opengl" feature to build, but can also optionally use the "wayland" feature if it is available. In this case, the recipe metadata might include:

```
REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES = "opengl"
ANY_OF_DISTRO_FEATURES = "wayland"

```

This indicates that the "opengl" feature is required for the recipe to build, but the recipe can also use the "wayland" feature if it is available. If the "wayland" feature is not available, the recipe can still build as long as the "opengl" feature is present.


***

**Human:**
EXTRA_OECMAKE

***

**Assistant:**

`EXTRA_OECMAKE` is a variable in the Yocto Project build system that allows you to add additional options to the CMake command line.

When you use the `cmake` class in a Yocto recipe, the `EXTRA_OECMAKE` variable can be used to add additional options to the `cmake` command that is executed during the build. These options are appended to the end of the `cmake` command, and they can be used to pass additional flags or variables to the CMake build system.

For example, if you wanted to add a `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` flag to the `cmake` command, you would add the following line to your recipe:

```
EXTRA_OECMAKE += "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON"

```

This would add the `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` flag to the `cmake` command line, which would enable the building of shared libraries.


***

**Human:**
PACKAGECONFIG

***

**Assistant:**

`PACKAGECONFIG` is a feature in the OpenEmbedded and Yocto Project build systems that allows the user to select various configuration options when building a package. Essentially, it allows users to choose which dependencies and features they want to include or exclude in the final package.

Using `PACKAGECONFIG`, a recipe author can define different build-time and run-time options for a package, each of which can be enabled or disabled by setting a corresponding configuration variable. These configuration variables are then used to control the build process and to generate appropriate package metadata.

For example, a recipe for a video player application might define `PACKAGECONFIG` options for different video codecs, such as MPEG-2, H.264, and VP9. The user building the package can then select which codecs to include by setting the appropriate configuration variables. The recipe can also define default options that are used if no configuration variables are set.

`PACKAGECONFIG` is a powerful tool for customizing packages, allowing users to build a package that meets their specific needs and requirements.


***

**Human:**
RRECOMENDS

***

**Assistant:**

In the context of a package recipe in OpenEmbedded/Yocto, `RRECOMMENDS` is a variable that specifies a list of packages that are recommended to be installed alongside the main package, but are not strictly required for its functionality.

When a recipe is built, its dependencies are analyzed and if any of the packages listed in `RRECOMMENDS` are available, they will also be included in the final image. However, if any of these recommended packages are not available or are explicitly excluded, they will not be included.

For example, in a recipe for a media player package, one might list several optional packages in `RRECOMMENDS` such as `gstreamer-plugins-good`, `gstreamer-plugins-bad`, and `ffmpeg`. These packages would be recommended to be installed alongside the main package, but are not required for basic functionality.


***

**Human:**
please teach bitbake variable usage?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure, I'd be happy to help!

In BitBake, variables are used extensively to customize the behavior of recipes and tasks. Here are the most common types of variables in BitBake:

1. 
Global variables: These variables are defined in the configuration files, such as `local.conf`, and are used across all recipes.

2. 
Recipe-specific variables: These variables are defined in a recipe's `.bb` file and are specific to that recipe.

3. 
Task-specific variables: These variables are defined in a task's `.bb` file and are specific to that task.



To use a variable, you simply need to reference its name with a dollar sign (`$`) in front of it. For example, to use the `SRC_URI` variable in a recipe, you could write:

```
SRC_URI = "https://example.com/my-source.tar.gz"

```

Then, you could reference this variable in another variable or in a command:

```
MY_VAR = "${SRC_URI}"
do_unpack() {
    tar xvf ${SRC_URI}
}

```

You can also set a default value for a variable by using the `:=` operator, which assigns the value immediately without deferring expansion. For example:

```
MY_VAR ?= "default-value"

```

This sets the default value of `MY_VAR` to "default-value" if it has not already been defined elsewhere.

In addition to these basic variable types, BitBake supports advanced variable features such as conditional expressions, shell commands, and variable expansion modifiers. These advanced features allow you to create more complex variables that can be customized based on the environment, the system configuration, or other factors.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.


***

**Human:**
what's builtin variables of bitbake?

***

**Assistant:**

There are several built-in variables in BitBake that can be used in recipes, configuration files, and classes. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `PN`: Package name.
- `PV`: Package version.
- `PR`: Package release.
- `P`: The full package name, which is `PN-PV`.

- `BBPATH`: A colon-separated list of directories where BitBake should look for recipes and other files.
- `BBFILES`: A space-separated list of recipe files that should be parsed by BitBake.
- `BBFILE_COLLECTIONS`: A list of file collections that should be parsed by BitBake.
- `BBFILE_PATTERN`: A pattern that BitBake uses to match recipe files to be parsed.
- `BBFILE_PRIORITY`: A priority value for recipe files that match `BBFILE_PATTERN`.
- `BB_DEFAULT_TASK`: The default task that should be executed by BitBake.
- `BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS`: A flag that determines whether BitBake should generate mirror tarballs.
- `BB_NUMBER_THREADS`: The number of parallel tasks that BitBake should run.
- `BB_TASK_NICE_LEVEL`: The nice level for tasks that are run by BitBake.
- `BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER`: The signature handler that should be used by BitBake.
- `BB_HASHCONFIG`: The hash configuration that should be used by BitBake.


These are just a few examples of the many built-in variables that are available in BitBake. You can find a complete list of them in the BitBake manual.

**Human:**
what's PACKAGE_ARCH:tegra?

***

**Assistant:**

PACKAGE_ARCH:tegra is a package architecture used in the Yocto Project/OpenEmbedded build system. It is used for packages that are built specifically for the NVIDIA Tegra platform, which includes various embedded systems and devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson line of development kits.

When PACKAGE_ARCH is set to tegra, the package is built with the Tegra-specific toolchain and libraries. This ensures that the package is optimized for the Tegra platform and takes advantage of its unique features, such as its GPU capabilities.

In general, PACKAGE_ARCH specifies the target architecture for a package, such as x86_64, armv7a, or aarch64. When followed by a colon and a specific value, such as tegra in this case, it indicates that the package is intended for a specific variant of that architecture.


***

**Human:**
what would happend when recipes overlap between layers?

***

**Assistant:**

When a recipe with the same name exists in multiple layers, the one in the higher-priority layer (usually defined by the `BBLAYERS` variable) will be used. Bitbake will first search in the highest-priority layer and work its way down through the layers until it finds a matching recipe.

If two recipes with the same name exist in the same layer, an error will occur during the parsing phase because Bitbake cannot determine which recipe to use. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid having multiple recipes with the same name in the same layer.


***

**Human:**
how to decide priority of the layers?

***

**Assistant:**

The priority of the layers in the build process is determined by the order in which they are added to the `BBLAYERS` variable in the `conf/bblayers.conf` file. The layers at the beginning of the list have higher priority than the layers at the end of the list.

For example, if a recipe is present in two layers, the recipe from the layer that is listed first in the `BBLAYERS` variable will be used.

It is important to carefully consider the order of the layers in the `BBLAYERS` variable, as it can affect the behavior of the build system. The layers containing core components, such as the BSP or the distribution configuration, should be listed before other layers. Layers that contain custom recipes or application-specific components can be added later in the list.

Additionally, the priority of the layers can be modified using the `PREFERRED_PROVIDER` and `PREFERRED_VERSION` variables. These variables can be set to specify which provider or version of a recipe to use, regardless of the layer priority.


***

**Human:**
how to decide which recipes to build for final image or just build all recipes from all layers?

***

**Assistant:**

Deciding which recipes to include in the final image depends on the specific requirements of the project or product. It is common to build only the necessary recipes required to generate a minimal image that meets the project's requirements.

To determine which recipes to include in the final image, you can inspect the dependencies of the packages used by the project, and build only those that are necessary to meet those dependencies. You can also review the contents of the layers used in the project to see which recipes they provide, and decide which of these are necessary for your final image.

Additionally, you can configure BitBake to exclude certain recipes from the final image by adding them to the `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE` variable in the local.conf file.

Ultimately, the decision of which recipes to include in the final image is project-specific and requires careful consideration of the project's requirements, dependencies, and available resources.

**Human:**
how to add a new machine?

***

**Assistant:**

To add a new machine to a Yocto Project build system, you need to perform the following steps:

1. 
Define the machine in a new or existing machine configuration file located in the `meta-mylayer/conf/machine` directory. The file should contain a machine name, the architecture, the CPU type, the endianness, and any other machine-specific configuration parameters.

2. 
If your machine requires a new Linux kernel, add a recipe for building the kernel in a new or existing recipe file located in the `meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux` directory. This recipe file should define the source URL and checksum, any required patches, kernel configuration parameters, and any other kernel-specific configuration.

3. 
If your machine requires a new bootloader, add a recipe for building the bootloader in a new or existing recipe file located in the `meta-mylayer/recipes-bsp` directory. This recipe file should define the source URL and checksum, any required patches, bootloader configuration parameters, and any other bootloader-specific configuration.

4. 
If your machine requires a new firmware or firmware update mechanism, add a recipe for building the firmware in a new or existing recipe file located in the `meta-mylayer/recipes-bsp` directory. This recipe file should define the source URL and checksum, any required patches, firmware configuration parameters, and any other firmware-specific configuration.

5. 
If your machine requires a new image recipe, add a new recipe file to the `meta-mylayer/recipes-core/images` directory. This recipe file should define the required packages, kernel image, bootloader, firmware, and any other machine-specific components required to build an image for your new machine.

6. 
Update the `MACHINE` variable in your build configuration file to include your new machine name.

7. 
Build the image for your new machine using the `bitbake` command with the `-k &lt;image-name&gt;` option, where `&lt;image-name&gt;` is the name of the image recipe file you added in step 5.

8. 
Test the image on your new machine, and iterate on the machine configuration and image recipe until the image is functional and meets your requirements.




***

**Human:**
how to learn about and know what’s packaged in the root filesystem.

***

**Assistant:**

To learn about the packages included in the root filesystem generated by the build process, you can inspect the contents of the rootfs directory.

In Yocto, the `rootfs` directory is usually located in the `tmp/deploy/images/&lt;machine&gt;` directory. For example, if your machine name is `raspberrypi3`, the rootfs directory would be located in `tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/`.

To see the list of packages installed in the root filesystem, you can use the `opkg` package manager. You can SSH into the target machine and run the following command:

```
opkg list-installed

```

This will list all the packages that are currently installed in the root filesystem. You can also use the `opkg` package manager to install additional packages on the target machine.

Note that the contents of the root filesystem may depend on the specific image recipe you used to build your image. Different image recipes may include different packages or configurations.


***

**Human:**
what's difference armv8a/armv8a_tegra/armv8a_tegra234 in  build/tmp/deploy/rpm 

***

**Assistant:**

The armv8a, armv8a_tegra, and armv8a_tegra234 in the build/tmp/deploy/rpm directory refer to different target architectures for the ARM 64-bit instruction set.

- armv8a is a generic architecture for ARMv8-A processors.
- armv8a_tegra is a specific architecture for the NVIDIA Tegra processors based on ARMv8-A instruction set.
- armv8a_tegra234 is a further specific architecture for the Tegra 2/3/4 processors based on ARMv8-A instruction set.


Each architecture may require different optimizations or features, and thus requires different software binaries to be built. When building packages, BitBake will create separate packages for each architecture to ensure that the correct binaries are installed on the target device.


***

**Human:**
so armv8a package can run on armv8a_gegra chips, right?

***

**Assistant:**

Yes, in general, packages built for the ARMv8-A architecture should be compatible with any ARMv8-A-based chip, including ARMv8-A-based NVIDIA Tegra chips like Tegra X1 and Tegra X2. However, it's always a good idea to verify compatibility with the specific chip you are targeting.


***

**Human:**
how to create my own image recipe basing on existing recipes?

***

**Assistant:**

To create your own custom image recipe based on existing recipes, you can follow these steps:

1. 
Create a new recipe file in your custom layer by running the command `bitbake-layers create-layer &lt;layer-name&gt;`. This will create a new layer with the given name in the `layers/` directory of your project.

2. 
Open the new recipe file and inherit the base image recipe you want to use. For example, if you want to create a custom image based on the `core-image-minimal` recipe, add the following line at the top of your recipe file:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>arduino</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-arduino p-4">inherit core-image-minimal
`</code></div></div></pre>
3. <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-arduino p-4">
Customize the recipe as per your requirements. You can add or remove packages, modify configuration files, etc. For example, to add a new package to your custom image, you can use the `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable in your recipe file:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>makefile</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile p-4">IMAGE_INSTALL += <span class="hljs-string">"my-package"</span>

4. <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-arduino p-4"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile p-4">
Once you have made the necessary changes to the recipe, add it to the list of recipes that should be built by BitBake. You can do this by adding the name of your recipe to the `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable in your `local.conf` file:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>makefile</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile p-4">IMAGE_INSTALL_append = <span class="hljs-string">" my-image-recipe"</span>

</code></code></code>


Note: It is recommended to create a separate custom layer for your image recipe instead of modifying the existing recipe files directly. This makes it easier to maintain your changes and prevents conflicts with other layers.


***

**Human:**
show me a sample for my custom image?

***

**Assistant:**

Certainly, here's a sample custom image recipe that you can use as a starting point:

```
SUMMARY = "Custom image for my project"
DESCRIPTION = "Custom image for my project based on poky distribution"

LICENSE = "MIT"

IMAGE_FEATURES += "ssh-server-openssh"

inherit core-image

# Add custom packages to the image
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " \
    package1 \
    package2 \
    package3 \
"

# Set the default root password
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"
inherit extrausers
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "\
    useradd -P password myuser; \
    usermod -aG sudo myuser; \
"

# Add additional configuration files
inherit extrausers
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "\
    useradd -P password myuser; \
    usermod -aG sudo myuser; \
"

```

This recipe sets up a custom image based on the core-image recipe with the following changes:

- Adds the `ssh-server-openssh` feature to the image.
- Installs additional packages `package1`, `package2`, and `package3` to the image.
- Sets the default root password and adds a new user `myuser` with sudo privileges.
- Adds additional configuration files.


You can modify this recipe to fit your project's specific requirements.


***

**Human:**
where to put the conf file?

***

**Assistant:**

The BitBake configuration files are usually stored in the `conf/` directory within the layer. This directory contains various configuration files that are used by BitBake during the build process.

To add your own custom configuration file, you can create a new file in the `conf/` directory of your layer, and give it a name that reflects its purpose (e.g. `myconfig.conf`). In this file, you can add any custom configuration variables or settings that you need for your build.

After creating your configuration file, you can add it to your build by including it in your build environment. You can do this by adding the following line to your `local.conf` file:

```
# Include my custom configuration file
BBFILES += "/path/to/myconfig.conf"

```

Replace `/path/to/` with the path to the directory containing your custom configuration file.


***

**Human:**
how does bitbake to search conf file such as require conf/xxxxx.conf

***

**Assistant:**

When you include a configuration file in a recipe or a layer using `require`, Bitbake searches for the file in several locations.

First, it looks for the file in the same directory as the recipe that includes it. If the file is not found there, Bitbake will look for the file in the `conf` directory of the layer that contains the recipe.

If the file is still not found, Bitbake will search in the `conf` directory of all the layers included in the `BBLAYERS` variable, in the order they are listed. The first file found will be used.

If Bitbake cannot find the configuration file in any of these locations, it will raise an error.


***

**Human:**
how to add proxies for yocto system as the netowrk access?

***

**Assistant:**

To add proxies for Yocto system, you can set the following environment variables in your terminal or add them to your `local.conf` file:

```
HTTP_PROXY = "http://<proxy_server_address>:<proxy_port>"
HTTPS_PROXY = "https://<proxy_server_address>:<proxy_port>"
FTP_PROXY = "ftp://<proxy_server_address>:<proxy_port>"

```

Replace `&lt;proxy_server_address&gt;` with the IP address or hostname of your proxy server and `&lt;proxy_port&gt;` with the port number used by the proxy server.

If your proxy server requires authentication, you can add the following variables as well:

```
PROXY_USER = "<proxy_username>"
PROXY_PASSWORD = "<proxy_password>"

```

Replace `&lt;proxy_username&gt;` and `&lt;proxy_password&gt;` with the username and password for your proxy server.

Once you have set these variables, Bitbake will use them to connect to the internet and download packages and dependencies.


***

**Human:**
how to add a package to an image?

***

**Assistant:**

To add a package to an image, you need to modify the corresponding image recipe.

1. 
Find the image recipe file in your Yocto project. The image recipe file name usually ends with `.bb` and is located in the `meta-&lt;layer&gt;/recipes-core/images` directory.

2. 
Open the image recipe file and add the package you want to include in the `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable. For example, if you want to add the `openssh` package, you would add the following line:
<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>makefile</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile p-4">IMAGE_INSTALL += <span class="hljs-string">"openssh"</span>

***

**Human:**
what's the difference and relation between a recipe and package?

***

**Assistant:**

In Yocto, a recipe is a set of instructions that tells Bitbake how to build a package. A recipe usually includes information such as the source code location, how to patch the source code, how to configure and compile the source code, and where to install the compiled binaries and other files.

On the other hand, a package is the result of the recipe build process, which includes compiled binaries, libraries, headers, and other files that are needed for the software to run on the target system. Packages are usually in the form of RPM, DEB, or IPK files that can be installed on the target system.

The recipe and package are related in that a recipe is used to build a package. Bitbake uses the recipe to download the source code, apply any necessary patches, configure and compile the source code, and generate the package. The package is then stored in the build directory, and can be added to an image or installed on the target system.


***

**Human:**
how to build a package by itself?

***

**Assistant:**

To build a package by itself using Bitbake, you can use the `bitbake &lt;package-name&gt;` command. For example, if you want to build the `openssh` package, you would run the command `bitbake openssh`.

By default, this will build the latest version of the package for your default machine and target architecture. If you want to build a specific version or for a specific target, you can use the `-b` and `-c` options respectively.

For example, to build version 7.9p1 of the `openssh` package for the `raspberrypi3` machine, you would run the command:

```
bitbake -b openssh-7.9p1 -c build -f -m raspberrypi3

```

This will build the specified version of the package for the specified machine. The `-c` option specifies the build action to perform, and the `-f` option forces the package to be built even if it is already up to date.


***

**Human:**
how to find out what files are in a package?

***

**Assistant:**

To find out what files are in a package, you can use the `rpm` command. For example, if you want to find out what files are in the `bash` package, you can run:

```
rpm -ql bash

```

This will list all the files in the `bash` package.

In Yocto, if you want to find out what files are in a package that you've built, you can look in the `tmp/work/&lt;machine&gt;/&lt;recipe&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/package/` directory. For example, if you've built the `bash` recipe for the `qemux86-64` machine, you can look in the `tmp/work/qemux86_64/bash/5.1.4-r0/package/` directory to see the files in the package.


***

**Human:**
how to find out what files are in an image?

***

**Assistant:**

To find out what files are in an image, you can use the `bitbake -e &lt;image&gt; | grep ^IMAGE_ROOTFS=` command. This command will print out the root filesystem directory of the specified image. For example, to find out what files are in the "core-image-minimal" image, you can use the following command:

```
bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^IMAGE_ROOTFS=

```

This will output something like:

```
IMAGE_ROOTFS="/path/to/yocto/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/core-image-minimal/1.0-r0/rootfs"

```

You can then navigate to this directory and list its contents to see what files are included in the image. For example, you can use the following command to list the files in the root filesystem directory:

```
ls -l /path/to/yocto/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/core-image-minimal/1.0-r0/rootfs

```

**Human:**
what's difference between machine and distro settings?

***

**Assistant:**

In Yocto, a machine is a hardware platform, while a distro is a software platform that defines how to build software for a specific hardware platform.

Machine settings specify the hardware-specific information needed to build software, such as the CPU architecture, memory size, boot loader, and kernel configuration. On the other hand, distro settings define the software components, configuration files, and settings that are required to build a complete Linux distribution for a particular hardware platform.

Machine settings are defined in the `conf/machine/&lt;machine-name&gt;.conf` file, while distro settings are defined in the `conf/distro/&lt;distro-name&gt;.conf` file.

**Human:**
how to find the right BSP for your hardware?

***

**Assistant:**

Finding the right Board Support Package (BSP) for your hardware depends on the type of hardware you have and the vendor who provides it. Here are some general steps you can follow:

1. Identify the manufacturer and model number of your hardware.
2. Visit the manufacturer's website and search for any available software downloads or resources related to your hardware.
3. Look for any BSPs that are specifically designed for your hardware. These may be listed as "Yocto Project BSP" or "Yocto Project support."
4. Check the Yocto Project website for any available BSPs for your hardware. The Yocto Project maintains a list of supported hardware and BSPs on their website.
5. If you cannot find a specific BSP for your hardware, look for BSPs that are designed for similar hardware. You may be able to modify these BSPs to work with your hardware.
6. If you still cannot find a BSP, you may need to create your own by creating a new machine configuration file and modifying existing BSPs.


It's important to note that not all hardware is compatible with the Yocto Project, and some hardware may require significant customization to work with the Yocto Project. It's always a good idea to consult with the manufacturer or vendor of your hardware to ensure compatibility and obtain any necessary resources.

**Human:**
how to use the devtool of yocto to simplify my workflow?

***

**Assistant:**

The `devtool` is a tool in Yocto that can help simplify the workflow for adding, modifying, and testing software packages. It allows you to create a new recipe, modify an existing recipe, and test the recipe without having to manually manage the build and deployment process.

Here is a brief guide on how to use `devtool`:

1. 
Install devtool: `sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm python3`

2. 
Initialize the build environment: `source poky/oe-init-build-env build-dir`

3. 
Create a new recipe: `devtool add mypackage`

4. 
Edit the recipe: `devtool modify mypackage`

5. 
Build the package: `devtool build mypackage`

6. 
Install the package: `devtool install mypackage`

7. 
Test the package: `devtool test mypackage`



The `devtool` will automatically manage the build and deployment process for you, making it much easier to test and modify software packages.

Note that `devtool` has many more features, such as support for different build systems, version control integration, and remote debugging. You can find more information on `devtool` in the Yocto Project documentation.

**Human:**
what's the task pipline and executing individual tasks?

***

**Assistant:**

In Yocto, a recipe can be thought of as a set of tasks that need to be executed to build a package. Each task performs a specific function, such as fetching the source code, applying patches, configuring, building, and packaging. Tasks are defined in a recipe file and can depend on other tasks, forming a pipeline of tasks.

When you run `bitbake &lt;recipe-name&gt;`, BitBake reads the recipe and generates a task pipeline based on the dependencies between the tasks. It then executes the tasks in order, starting from the first task that has no unmet dependencies.

You can also execute individual tasks using the `bitbake -c &lt;task-name&gt; &lt;recipe-name&gt;` command. For example, `bitbake -c configure &lt;recipe-name&gt;` will execute only the configure task for the specified recipe.

This approach provides a lot of flexibility and allows you to build packages incrementally, by selectively executing specific tasks. It also enables BitBake to automatically track dependencies between tasks, ensuring that each task is executed in the correct order and that all prerequisites are met before a task is executed.

**Human:**
how to improve build speeds with shared downloads and shared state cache?

***

**Assistant:**

To improve build speeds in Yocto, you can take advantage of shared downloads and a shared state cache.

Shared downloads allow multiple builds to use the same download directory, rather than each build downloading the same source files individually. To enable shared downloads, you can set the `DL_DIR` variable in your `local.conf` file to a shared directory path that is accessible by all users and builds.

```
DL_DIR = "/path/to/shared/downloads"

```

Shared state cache allows multiple builds to reuse compiled binaries and other artifacts from previous builds, rather than rebuilding everything from scratch. To enable shared state cache, you can set the `SSTATE_DIR` variable in your `local.conf` file to a shared directory path that is accessible by all users and builds.

```
SSTATE_DIR = "/path/to/shared/state/cache"

```

You can also configure Yocto to use a binary package feed to download and install pre-built packages instead of building them from source. This can further improve build speeds by reducing the amount of time spent building packages.

To use a binary package feed, you need to create a package feed server that hosts pre-built packages, and configure Yocto to use the server. Yocto supports multiple package feed formats, such as RPM, Debian, and IPK.

Additionally, you can use the `BB_NUMBER_THREADS` and `PARALLEL_MAKE` variables to adjust the number of parallel threads used during the build process. These variables control the number of concurrent tasks that can run during the build process.

```
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4"

```

These variables can be set in your `local.conf` file or passed as command-line arguments to the `bitbake` command. Adjust the values based on the number of available CPU cores and memory to optimize the build speed.

**Human:**
how to create a software bill of materials ?

***

**Assistant:**

A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a document that lists the components, dependencies, and other details of a software project. This document is used for software supply chain management, vulnerability management, and compliance. In Yocto Project, you can create an SBOM using the OpenEmbedded `devtool` utility.

Here are the general steps to create an SBOM using `devtool`:

1. Ensure that `devtool` is installed on your system. If not, install it using the following command:


```
sudo apt-get install devtool

```
<ol start="2">Create a new recipe for your project using `devtool`:</li></ol>
```
devtool add <project-name>

```
<ol start="3">Navigate to the recipe directory:</li></ol>
```
cd <project-name>

```
<ol start="4">Add the `SBOM_GENERATE` variable to the recipe's configuration file:</li></ol>
```
echo 'SBOM_GENERATE = "1"' >> conf/local.conf

```
<ol start="5">Build the recipe using `bitbake`:</li></ol>
```
bitbake <project-name>

```
<ol start="6">The SBOM file will be generated in the `&lt;build-directory&gt;/tmp/work/&lt;machine-name&gt;/&lt;recipe-name&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/SBOM` directory.</li></ol>
You can also generate an SBOM for an existing recipe by adding the `SBOM_GENERATE` variable to the recipe's configuration file and then rebuilding the recipe using `bitbake`. The SBOM file will be generated in the same directory as above.

Note that `devtool` automatically generates an SBOM for every recipe that is created using it. You can find the SBOM file in the recipe's directory.

**Human:**
what does workspace use?

***

**Assistant:**

In the context of Yocto Project, a workspace is a directory where you keep all the directories of the different Yocto Project layers and their respective metadata files. It is the main directory where you run the `bitbake` command to build your target image.

The workspace typically includes the following directories:

- `poky`: The main Yocto Project reference distribution layer.
- `meta`: A directory where you can put your own layers.
- `build`: The directory where you run the `bitbake` command to build your target image.
- `downloads`: A directory where shared downloads can be stored to speed up builds.
- `sstate-cache`: A directory where shared state cache can be stored to speed up builds.


Using a workspace provides a structured way of organizing your layers and build environment, making it easier to maintain and share with others.

**Human:**
bitbake basic syntax rules

***

**Assistant:**

Here are some basic syntax rules for using BitBake:

1. BitBake commands are written in lowercase.
2. Each command must be written on a separate line.
3. Lines beginning with the # character are treated as comments.
4. Variables are defined using the VAR = value syntax.
5. Variables can be used by placing them in ${} brackets.
6. Recipes are defined in .bb files.
7. Each recipe must define at least one task (do_compile, do_install, etc.).
8. The order in which tasks are run is defined by the dependencies between them.
9. Tasks can be skipped by appending -taskname to the recipe name.
10. BitBake recipes can be extended or modified using include, inherit, and append commands.


These are just some basic rules, and BitBake has a lot of flexibility and advanced features beyond this.


***

**Human:**
what is used to implement bitbake?

***

**Assistant:**

BitBake is implemented in Python and uses a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Python syntax. It is designed to be modular and extensible, with a plugin-based architecture that allows users to add their own custom functionality. BitBake also integrates with various other tools and technologies, such as the OpenEmbedded build system and various version control systems.

**Human:**
how to do automation testing with a yocto project, auto build image and flash device and run testing on the device and merge changes

***

**Assistant:**

To automate testing with a Yocto project, you can use tools like OpenEmbedded Autobuilder or BuildBot to auto-build images and flash them onto a device. Once the device is ready, you can use test frameworks such as LAVA, Robot Framework, or PyTest to run tests on the device. These tests can be customized based on your project needs, such as functionality testing, performance testing, or integration testing. Once the tests are complete, the results can be collected and analyzed for any issues or bugs. Finally, the changes can be merged back into the project using a version control system like Git. By automating testing, you can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure the quality of your Yocto project.


***

**Human:**
what's LAVA and Robot Framework?

***

**Assistant:**

LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture) is an open-source framework for automated testing of embedded devices. It provides an automated test system that can flash, boot, and test a wide range of hardware devices, including boards based on ARM, x86, and MIPS architectures. LAVA allows users to define test jobs and run them on a variety of hardware platforms. The test results are collected and presented in an easy-to-understand format.

Robot Framework is a generic open-source automation framework that can be used for automated testing, acceptance testing, and robotic process automation (RPA). It has an easy-to-use syntax that supports a range of testing approaches, including keyword-driven, data-driven, and behavior-driven testing. Robot Framework is highly extensible, allowing users to write custom test libraries and integrate with other tools and frameworks. It is widely used in the software industry for automated testing and has good integration with LAVA for embedded device testing.

**Human:**
tell me more on LAVA and show me how to use it

***

**Assistant:**

LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture) is an open-source test automation framework that is commonly used in the Yocto Project for testing and validation of embedded Linux systems. LAVA allows for automated testing of hardware and software components across a wide range of devices and architectures.

To use LAVA, you need to set up a LAVA instance, which involves installing LAVA packages, configuring the LAVA server, creating user accounts, and setting up the LAVA dispatcher to communicate with your target devices. Once your LAVA instance is set up, you can use it to automate the testing of your Yocto Project images on target devices.

To use LAVA, you would typically write a test job definition in YAML format that specifies the test cases to run and the device(s) to run them on. You can also use the LAVA web interface or the LAVA API to schedule and monitor test jobs. The LAVA scheduler will automatically queue test jobs and assign them to available devices for execution.

In addition to LAVA, you can also use Robot Framework, which is a generic test automation framework, to write and run test cases for your Yocto Project images. Robot Framework provides a keyword-driven testing approach and supports a wide range of test libraries, including libraries for testing network protocols, web applications, and mobile devices. You can use Robot Framework to automate testing of your Yocto Project images in conjunction with LAVA or as a standalone test framework.


***

**Human:**
show me an example of LAVA?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure, here is an example of how to use LAVA to automate testing on a Yocto-based embedded system:

1. Install LAVA and its dependencies on a separate Linux machine or a virtual machine.
2. Configure LAVA to communicate with the target device.
3. Create a test job in LAVA that specifies the test cases to run on the target device.
4. Write Robot Framework scripts to automate the test cases.
5. Upload the Robot Framework scripts to LAVA and include them in the test job.
6. Schedule the test job to run on the target device using LAVA's scheduling system.
7. Monitor the test job as it runs, and collect the results once it completes.
8. Analyze the results to identify any issues or failures, and make any necessary changes to the Yocto configuration or code.
9. Repeat the process until all tests pass and the system is fully validated.


Overall, LAVA provides a powerful platform for automating the testing of Yocto-based embedded systems, making it easier to ensure the quality and reliability of these complex systems.
